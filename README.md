# react-url-short-api

This project is a challenge from Frontend Mentor, a platform that offers web design and development challenges to practice and improve my skills. The goal was to create a web page that would allow URL shortening using the shrtcode API, a free link shortening service. For this project, I used ReactJS, Axios and Sass technologies, which helped me create a dynamic, responsive and stylish interface. I learned how to consume data from an external API, manage component state and validate user inputs. I also applied the design principles and good coding practices proposed by Frontend Mentor. It should be noted that this project was focused on meeting the challenge proposed by the platform, so the shortened links do work and can be copied and shared, but the other links on the page, such as login or social networks, have no real functionality, as it was not the main objective of the challenge. However, I am satisfied with the result and what I learned in the process.
